    <p id="storyp">sisterhood is a unicase serif typeface that is concerned with the communication of feminist theory and practice. it is unique in that it has been made only in lowercase letterforms, and symbols have been created in the place of capital letters. the end result is an accessible font that has the potential for use in many different contexts to communicate critical feminist voices with unique type treatments.<br><br>
there are many rules and conventions present in language that are seldom broken down or questioned. in english and most latin languages, capital letters are used to identify proper nouns and to mark the beginning of a sentence. by breaking this convention, we immediately create a shift in people’s perceptions of language and spark dialogue. throughout recent history, there have been many examples of people using lowercase letters in their writing to communicate a variety of different messages. for the purpose of this typeface, my audience may interpret the rejection of capital letterforms however they wish and they can use it in any way that may appeal to their needs. however, my personal interpretation of this conscious design choice is that by using only lowercase letters, we create a situation where all words are equal and of the same visual impact. this concept is furthered by the fact that this font is only available in one weight.<br><br>
the tone of the writing changes also, becoming more approachable and friendly, making the content of the writing seem almost casual. these visual and linguistic effects tie into the overall message of feminism that i wish to portray. as an intersectional feminist, i believe that all voices have relevance and impact. by visually breaking down some of the hierarchies present in language, there is a levelling-out of power among words. in addition to this, the informal quality of writing in capital letters makes for an accepting environment where all people can feel included in the feminist movement. a big factor in effecting successful change is getting everyone on board, so by making messages more visually approachable we can reach a wider audience of people and begin to break down barriers.<br><br>
 sisterhood is a creative typeface that people can use to express their thoughts and messages with the integration of symbols and alternative emotive punctuation. the font package also comes with a guide that explains which capital letters correspond with which symbols and alternative punctuation. three distinct sets of alternative punctuation have been included to express different voices: love (U), resistance (Y), and power (I). the user is able to mix and match the different sets to express their emotions in a new way not commonly explored within typography. sisterhood can be used like any other font in writing including messages, letters, posts, and publications. however, the added toolset that accompanies the classic letterforms gives way to a myriad of possible applications. <br><br>
since this typeface has been made with inclusivity in mind, it was very important to me that this font is available to as many people as possible. sisterhood can be downloaded for free and used for any purposes with only one condition; that it is used to help people and not to harm them. i would like to add on to this typeface in the future to include even more languages and symbols. this project will likely grow and change in the future as i gain new insights from my experiences.
